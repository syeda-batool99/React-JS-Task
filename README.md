# React-JS-Task

I have used the following approach:
 - Convert the array of airports into a graph.
 - Applied Dijkstra Algorithm to find the lowest cost path amongst the starting and ending airports.
 
 To run the file please use the following command:
 *node test.js*
 
 You will get a prompt which will ask for starting point. In that prompt, please enter your departure airport.
 Then you will get a prompt which will ask for ending point. In that prompt, please enter your destination airport.
 
 The final result will represent the lowest cost and the path which gives the lowest from departure airport to destination airport.
